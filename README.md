# TheBoilerRoom
This is a WPF application that will allow us developers to create custom boiler plates.

This application allows you to choose from various architectural options and .NET frameworks. Also, through selectors, it lets you add to the base application custom HTTP clients, mailing systems, HTTP status codes, custom exception system architectures, SignalR, etc. When you choose one of these options, it will allow you to select from the different available libraries and will add the necessary initialization code so that you can later adapt it to your specific case.This will allow us a much faster development of our applications.
